Just put it in your forge mods folder, toggle key is, ', lower cps is -, higher cps is =, you can change all theses in the controls screen.

You must have a shulker and hopper to have it toggled on, default cps is 13.

This is confirmed working on endcrystal.me, may need to put cps lower on 2b2t.

And theres acouple issue, but i dont care enough to fix them.
